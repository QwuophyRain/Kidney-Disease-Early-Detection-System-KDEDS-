Scientific Problem
The delayed diagnosis of kidney diseases represents a critical healthcare challenge, leading to poorer patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Current diagnostic approaches often rely on reactive rather than predictive measures, with fragmented data analysis systems that fail to identify early warning signs across diverse patient datasets. The complex, multifactorial nature of kidney disease progression requires sophisticated analysis of numerous biomarkers, patient history, and real-time physiological data that current systems cannot efficiently process.
